# Introduction
These are my javascript applications. I wrote these applications using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript. 

## Usage
In order to use or test these applications, you already had been downloaded the zip folder to your device and start the main html files by either double clicking on them or using cmd.

```batch
cd Desktop\customer-support
index.html
```

## Editing
You can edit and improve these files using my favorite text editor, Atom. You can improve your atom text editor, by installing packages, themses and setting your own prefered settings. You can install script package to run applications within Atom text editor. You can install minimap package to have a minimap open, on the right side of your Atom window.
